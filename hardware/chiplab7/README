This directory contains board support functions and definitions for the AVR32B0-EK by chiplab7.

I found this really cool AVR32 board on TaoBao. It is designed by a chinese company
called chiplab7, most information about the board is in chinese or Google-
translated chinglish. From what I read on the net it seems to be similar to
Atmel's EVK1101 in some aspects but this board has a 128x64 pixel OLED display
connected to the SPI on the UC3. It is also equipped with an microSD-slot and a
WM8978 stereo audio codec including two 3.5mm sockets and an onboard speaker.
In addition it has a 5-directional joystick and a light sensor.
Unfortunately it seems impossible to buy these boards any more, chiplab7 has
removed it from their website and taobao site and replaced it with an inferior
ARM-powered thing.

Correction: it is available here: http://chiplab7.com/goods.php?id=2
